## 🔎 Background

I am a blockchain developer and an AI enthusiast with an academic background in Artificial Intelligence. With the surge in cryptocurrency adoption and advancements in AI—such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs—I have observed a unique intersection of these technologies. This inspired the creation of **CryptoGuardAI**, a tool designed to address a pressing issue in the blockchain ecosystem.

## 🤔 Problem Statement

As the cryptocurrency market grows, with Ethereum and other digital assets experiencing unprecedented surges, the volume and complexity of smart contracts deployed have increased. However, the decentralized nature of blockchain also leaves it vulnerable to malicious contracts, coding errors, and security breaches, which can result in devastating financial losses.

Current smart contract auditing methods are often manual, time-intensive, and require deep domain expertise. Additionally, they struggle to keep pace with the rapid deployment of decentralized applications (DApps). Meanwhile, the rise of advanced AI models like LLMs presents an opportunity to revolutionize how we approach smart contract analysis and security.

**CryptoGuardAI** bridges this gap by combining blockchain expertise with the power of AI to create an automated, efficient, and reliable auditing solution for smart contracts.
